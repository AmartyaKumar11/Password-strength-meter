# Password Strength Meter 🔒

A simple and interactive **Password Strength Meter** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This tool visually evaluates the strength of a password and provides instant feedback, helping users create more secure passwords.

## Features 🌟
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Updates password strength as the user types.
- **Strength Levels**: Classifies passwords into categories like Weak, Medium, Strong, and Very Strong.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Changes the meter's color and width based on password strength.
- **Customizable Rules**: Easily extendable to define custom password strength rules.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Clean and responsive interface for seamless user experience.

## How It Works 🚀
The password strength is evaluated based on:
1. **Length**: Longer passwords are generally stronger.
2. **Character Variety**: Includes lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
3. **Common Patterns**: Avoids common patterns or dictionary words.

The meter displays a visual representation of the password strength, from Weak to Very Strong, using color-coded feedback.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **HTML**: Structure of the password input field and strength meter.
- **CSS**: Styling for the meter, including dynamic color changes and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for evaluating password strength and updating the meter dynamically.
